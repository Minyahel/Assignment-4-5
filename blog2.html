                <h2 class="title">We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px? How does the browser interpret that?</h2>
                <p>
                    Default font-size of 16px is more or less the same accross many devices and browsers alike. This is the default size of the html document and it is the root 
                    font-size of the document. This ofcourse is specified in the user-stylesheet the browser has and it will remain the same size unless either the user or the
                    the developer changes it. The user can change this value in the settings of his browser and the developer can change it in his style sheet.  
                    say a user changes the value of the default size from 16px to 200px, what would happen? <br> This would affect some aspects of the rendering of pages while 
                    it doesn't affect others. Let's startwith what isn't affected by this change,
                    in short, everything that has sizes set in absolute measurement values such as px or pt or cm..  which do not take into account the users preferences. 
                    On the other hand, what would be affected is any type of measurement that uses values that are relative, either em, rem or %. Any font that uses rem 
                    anywhere on the web page will be affected while only those fonts that use em and  % and come right after the root element and any subsequent relatively sized
                    elements are affected.

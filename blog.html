            <h2 class="title">Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Yes!, using these values instead of hardcoded pixel values is important because they allow our page to be responsive. But how?, to understand 
                    that we need a primer on %, em and rem<br>
                    percent %<br>
                    % values apply to pretty much every size related property is css and the way they work is pretty simple. When you use percent measurnment, 
                    context and target are taken into account and the end result is found. Here, target is the size of the element we are resizing(target size) 
                    and context is the size of the containing element. So, when we need to find the percent whe have to apply, all we have to do is divide the 
                    target by the context and then multiply the result by one hundred. Now this applies to almost all attributes that are inherited such as 
                    width, font-size etc. meaning that each value assigned a percent value will take the context of the same property, meaning that width will
                        take the context size of the parent's width and so on for other properties.
                    https://www.sitepoint.com/power-em-units-css/<br>
                    em<br>
                    what about the em unit. The em unit takes a predefined measurnment value from the context and multiplies it with the constant given in front
                    of the em unit such as 1em, 1.5em and so on. So thent the em unit works in a way very similar to percent however there is one crucial difference. 
                    The em unit is only concerned with the font size of the context. meaning that even if we assign an em value for width or other non font properties,
                    the initial em value is taken from the font-size of the parent element.<br>
                    rem<br>
                    As the name suggests, the rem unit is very similar to the em measurnment value. Similar to the em value, rem is only concerned with font size value 
                    but what differs is that rem value doen't take the inital measurnment from the context but from the font size of the root element i.e.  the font size
                    of the html document. Even though developers don't usually change the root font size, this value is generally accepted to be 16px since that is the
                    default value used in almost every browser.
                    now that we understand that, how do these values allow us to have a responsive website. These values allow us to have a responsive website in that 
                    they are relative to each other. If  a user were to change the size of the root font, then that size would cascade down and have an effect on every
                        browser font. As for the zoom, the zoom applies a blank increase or decrease ratio for every measurement on screen.

            <h2 class="title">We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Default font-size of 16px is more or less the same accross many devices and browsers. This is the default size of the html document and it is the root 
                    font-size of the document. This ofcourse is specified in the user-stylesheet the browser has and it will remain the same size unless the user changes 
                    the value in the browser's settings or the developer changes the value in his stylesheet. Let's say a user changes the value of the default size from 
                    16px to 200px. This affects some aspects of the rendering of pages while it doesn't affect others. Let's startwith what isn't affected by this change,
                        in short, everything that has sizes set in absolute measurement values such as px or pt or cm..  which do not take into account the users preferences. 
                        On the other hand, what would be affected is any type of measurement that uses values that are relative, either em, rem or %. Any font that uses rem 
                        any where on the web page will be affected while only those fonts that use em and  % and come right after the root element meaning the first font in 
                        the page are affected.

            <h2 class="title">Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3</h2>
            <article>       
                <p>
                    There are many changes that were brought about with CCS3 and the major ones are listed below
                    <dl>
                        <dt>New Selectors</dt>
                            <dd>
                                With the arrival of CSS3 a host of new selectors have been introduced that make the styling process a lot easier.<br>
                                Many of these changes allow us to narrow down the selection process.
                                <h3>Attribute Selectors</h3>
                                These selectors allow us to apply formatting to certain tags that have attributes we need
                                <ul>
                                    <li>E[attribute="value"]: Elements of E type which attribute is equal to its "value"</li>
                                </ul>
                                These attribute selectors can also work like regular expressions where we can select a value based on it's alphabet
                                <h3>Position Selectors</h3>
                                These selectors work based on the position of the element in the document.
                                Each specific selector is listed below
                                <ul>
                                    <li>:root -> selects the root element</li>
                                    <li>E:nth-child(N) -> selects the element of E type that is the N<sup>th</sup> child of it's parent</li>
                                    <li>E:nth-last-child(N) -> the same as the above but starting from the last element</li> 
                                    <li>E:nth-of-type(N) -> selects the N<sup>th</sup> element of E type in the father element</li>
                                    <li>E:nth-last-of-type(N) -> the same as the above but starting from the last element</li>
                                    <li>E:first-of-type -> selects an element of E type that comes first in the father element</li>
                                    <li>E:last-of-type -> the same as the above but starting from the last element</li>
                                    <li>E:only-child -> selects an element of E type that is the only child of its father element</li>
                                    <li>E:only-of-type -> selects an element of any type the is the only child of it's type in it's parent</li>                                       
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Pseudo-Element selectors</h3>
                                Pseudo-element selectors were available in CSS2 however
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Animation</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A CSS animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. The whole concept of CSS animations was introduced in CSS3.
                                below are a list of CSS properties that were introduced that allow us to make animations.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>animation -> specifies animations</li>
                                    <li>animation-delay -> specifies a delay before the animation starts</li>
                                    <li>animation-direction -> specifies the direction the animation will play in</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Background</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Background CSS properties were available before CSS3 but CSS3 introduced some key attributes for controlling background.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>background-clip -> specifies where the background should end as in  the border-box, padding-box or content-box</li>
                                    <li>background-origin -> specifies wehre the background should start </li>
                                    <li>background-size -> specifies the size of the background</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Border</dt>
                                An ability to create and control border properties existed before CSS3 but with CSS3 important features were added. They are listed below.
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>border-radius -> defines the shape of the border corners of an element</li>
                                    <li>border-image -> specifies the usage of an image for a border </li>
                                </ul>
                                In addition to this, there are specifics that control border-radius and border-image
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Color</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The color property existed before CSS3 but CSS3 added opacity that allows us to control the transparency of any element. It also added functionality for 
                                linear gradient and radial gradient.
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Flexible Box Layout</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Flexible Box or FlexBox for short was a completely new addition to CSS3 that allows us to place elements on screen in a completely new way.
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Font Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                CSS3 didn't get much innovation when it comes to fonts and it added two rather non frequently used properties. The first one is font-size-adjust which specifies
                                which type of characters to base the font size on and the other one is font-stretch that condenses and stretches fonts. 
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Multi-column layout Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Multi-column layout is a completely new addition to CSS3 that allows the usage of multiple columns to present info.<br>
                                The following are the properties that are used to control this.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>column-count -> specifies the number of columns that will be used</li>
                                    <li>column-fill -> specifies how columns will be filled</li>
                                    <li>column-gap -> specifies the gap between columns</li>
                                    <li>column-rule -> specifies what kind of line will be drawn between columns</li>
                                    <li>column-span -> specifies how many columns an element will span across</li>
                                </ul>
                                Those are the main properties but other shorthand properties can be used as well
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Outline Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Outlines are like borders for the element box and they are not new in CSS3, however, it introduced outline-offset that allows to increase the space
                                between an outline and the border edge of an element
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Text Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Text properties were not a new addition to CSS3, however it introduced properties that allow for greater text control. The properties are listed below.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>tab-size  -> specifies the length of the tab character</li>
                                    <li>text-align-last -> specifies how the last line of a block is aligned</li>
                                    <li>text-decoration-color -> specifies the color 
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Transform Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The transform properties were new additions to CSS3 and they allow us to apply 2D or 3D transformations to an element such as rotating, scaling and moving elements.
                                The following new tags associated with CSS3 allow us to perform those actions.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>backface-visibility -> specifies whether or not the back side of the element will be visible upon transformation</li>
                                    <li>perspective -> defines the perspective from which all child elements of an object are viewed</li>
                                    <li>perspective-origin -> defines the origin (the vanishing point for the 3D space) for the perspective property</li>
                                    <li>transform -> applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Transitions Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Transitions were new additions to CSS3 and they were created with the aim of changing property values of elements smoothly and with a controlled delay.
                                The following tags allow us to perform transitions. The transition properties however, have to be applied in junction with pseudo-elements.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>transition -> this is a shorthand property that allows us to control which property of an element changes and the delay it takes</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        <dt>Visual Formatting Properties</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Visual formatting properties apply to the kind of properties of an element that apply to an element's display and position within the document.
                                Not many additions have been made to this property, however, the new changes are listed below.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>overflow-x -> specifies how content is dealt with if it overflows in the x direction</li>
                                    <li>overflow-y -> specifies how content is dealt with if it overflows in the y direction</li>
                                    <li>resize ->  specifies whether or not an element is resizable by the user</li>
                                    <li>box-shadow -> allows us to apply a shadow to the element's box</li>
                                    <li>box-sizing -> alters the default CSS box-model</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                    </dl>

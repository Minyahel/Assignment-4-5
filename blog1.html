                <h2 class="title">Why Using Relative Sizes Could Make Our Designs Responsive</h2>
                <p id="date">Mar 18,2020</p>
                <p>
                    "Responsive Design" - the holy grail for web designers and a much sought after quality among web design groups and elites, but what does it
                    actually mean?<br>
                    Responisive Web Design to describe briefly is to use HTML and CSS magic to make web pages resize, hide, shrink and enlarge to look good on all
                    devices. Well, it isn't actually magic but a set of well understood and implemented properties that do acheive that. Look at the image below to see
                    how the website changes across devices. Now while that covers many aspects of responsiveness, we can use some measurements to acheive responsiveness.<br>

                    Now, there is one question that we must ask inorder to understand how to implement responsiveness<br>
                    "Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive? Why?"<br>
                    Yes!, using these values instead of hardcoded pixel values is important because they allow our page to be responsive. But how?, to understand 
                    that we need a primer on %, em and rem.
                    <h3>% (percent)</h3>
                    % values apply to pretty much every size related property is css and the way they work is pretty simple. When you use percent measurnment, 
                    context and target are taken into account and the end result is found. Here, target is the size of the element we are resizing(target size) 
                    and context is the size of the containing element. So, when we need to find the percent whe have to apply, all we have to do is divide the 
                    target by the context and then multiply the result by one hundred. Now this applies to almost all attributes that are inherited such as 
                    width, font-size etc. meaning that each value assigned a percent value will take the context of the same property, meaning that width will
                    take the context size of the parent's width and so on for other properties.<br>
                    Now this could make our design respond to different screen sizes if we set our width, height, margins and padding in percent since it will be calculated 
                    the width of the viewport i.e. the screen of the users' device and thus will automaticaly adjust to different screen sizes.
                    <h3>em</h3>
                    what about the em unit. The em unit takes a predefined measurnment value from the context and multiplies it with the constant given in front
                    of the em unit such as 1em, 1.5em and so on. So thent the em unit works in a way very similar to percent however there is one crucial difference. 
                    The em unit is only concerned with the font size of the context. meaning that even if we assign an em value for width or other non font properties,
                    the initial em value is taken from the font-size of the parent element.
                    The em unit will generally help our design become responsive but not quite as much as percent since it takes it context value from font-size. It is preferable to 
                    use em for font-related properties rather than as a general measurement unit.
                    <h3>rem</h3>
                    As the name suggests, the rem unit is very similar to the em measurnment value. Similar to the em value, rem is only concerned with font size value 
                    but what differs is that rem value doen't take the inital measurnment from the context but from the font size of the root element i.e.  the font size
                    of the html document. Even though developers don't usually change the root font size, this value is generally accepted to be 16px since that is the
                    default value used in almost every browser.<br><br>
                    Now that we understand that, how do these values allow us to have a responsive website. These values allow us to have a responsive website in that 
                    they are relative to each other. If  a user were to change the size of the root font, then that size would cascade down and have an effect on every
                    browser font. And for this reason alone, I believe that all text sizing should be represented in relative values because it allows for our website 
                    to be easily accesible and readable to anyone who might visit it. This would also make our website suitable for various screen sizes, resizing automatically
                    whenever necessary.<br><br> As for the zoom, the zoom applies a blanket increase or decrease ratio for every 
                    measurement on screen. While we may think that this nulls the requirement for using relative values since it would allow users to increase the size of
                    text, it actually provides a different experience. Zoom applies to every object on the screen, even to images and other non-text elements, and these elements 
                    would get inlarge as well if a user applies it. Yes, this increases the size of the text but it completely ruins the layout of our website and ruins the experience 
                    for the user. And because of that reason, we should not think of zoom as a substitue for using relative sizes. <br>

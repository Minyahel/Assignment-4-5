            <article>
                <p>
                    "Responsive Design" - the holy grail for web designers and a much sought after quality among web design groups and elites, but what does it
                    actually mean?<br>
                    Responisive Web Design to describe briefly is to use HTML and CSS magic to make web pages resize, hide, shrink and enlarge to look good on all
                    devices. Well, it isn't actually magic but a set of well understood and implemented properties that do acheive that. Look at the image below to see
                    how the website changes across devices. Now while that covers many aspects of responsiveness, we can use some measurements to acheive responsiveness<br>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Do browsers have a default font-size?<br>
                    Yes they do and this is true across many browsers, on any device. While browsers having a default font-size is good and eases a lot of design problems, we 
                    this can get confusing sometimes and we should know what would happen if font-size were changed from 16px to 200px.

            <article>
                <p>       
                    CSS3 has been in development since 1999 and it built upon the features of CSS2 and CSS1. Because of it's modularization, it doesn't have a specific release date
                    but rather different modules were released in different year and even more features are in development. CSS3 has added important modules and updates for important 
                    aspects of web design while at the same time it introduced various other features that didn't exist before. Below, I have detailed the changes that it introduced as 
                    well as which features it introduced were completely new.
